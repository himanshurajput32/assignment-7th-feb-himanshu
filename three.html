    Free CSS has 2494 free website templates coded using HTML & CSS in its gallery. The HTML website templates that are
    showcased on Free CSS.com are the best that can
    be found in and around the net. We would personally like to thank all of the website template designers and
    developers for all of their hard work in creating these
    free website templates. Without them Free CSS would probably not exist.
